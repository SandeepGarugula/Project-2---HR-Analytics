# Project-2---HR-Analytics 
Hello everyone,

Finally! I successfully conducted project 2, HR Analytics which was assigned by MeriSKILL . The project requires delving into the real world of human resources, with a keen eye on data analysis to optimize talent management and organizational performance. 

Page 1 offers a summary of the four dashboards I've developed. Following that, the second page presents demographic insights, the third delves into turnover analysis 1, the fourth into turnover analysis 2, and the last page is dedicated to employee wellness.

Page 2 is a demographic report summarizing employee statistics, including age groups, gender, distance from home, and marital status, providing insights into workforce diversity and commuting patterns for informed decision-making.

Page 3 is the turnover analysis 1 report providing insights into employee attrition, including departure by department, job roles affected, business travel impact, and total years in the current role, aiding in workforce management and retention strategies.

Page 4 visualizes turnover analysis 2 report consolidate employee data, featuring attrition by job level, overtime performance ratings, monthly income, and attrition increase levels, offering critical insights for effective HR strategies and decision-making.

Page 5 is an analysis report that provides insights of employee wellness featuring average monthly income, average hourly rate, relationship satisfaction, environmental satisfaction, performance ratings, work life balance, and job involvement for effective decision-making.

It was a tough but insightful task. I'm proud of myself for the accomplishment
